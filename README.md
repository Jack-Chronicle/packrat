# **Packrat** üêÄ

![](./packrat.gif)

This plugin for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) adds functionality to Martin Schenck's indispensable  [Obsidian Tasks](https://github.com/schemar/obsidian-tasks) plugin.

| :exclamation:  Don't install **Packrat** unless you use **Tasks**! |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|

**Tasks** supports tasks with recurrence rules:  when **Tasks** is used to mark a recurring task as having been completed, it inserts the next instance of that task in a new line above the just-completed instance.

## And what's wrong with that?

The above behavior is "alright"; but *completed instances of recurring tasks* tend to accumulate in the note file in which they originate.  Items that recur every few days, or even every week, quickly begin to clutter up the note they're in.

## What are you gonna do about it?

After some reflection, I realized that my completed recurring tasks fall into three categories:

1. those that I don't care to keep -- they can be deleted
2. those that I want to retain in their original note file -- but moved to the end/bottom
3. those that I want to move to a separate archival note file)

By including within your recurring tasks a 'trigger' that identifies which of the above actions you want to apply to your completed instances, we can automate those actions.

## Default "triggers"

The *default* "trigger" for each **Packrat** action takes the form of an *html comment* (text surrounded by a two pairs of % characters):

| Default trigger | Action on completed recurring task instance     |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------ |
| %%done_end%%    | Move task to the bottom of the active note file |
| %%done_log%%    | Append task to designated archive file          |
| %%done_del%%    | Delete task                                     |

I chose to use *comments* because they aren't displayed in **Obsidian**'s Preview mode, and also to keep them out of its *Tag* pane.

However, you can change the trigger values within **Packrat**'s settings -- to #tags, or @values, or any other string (including Unicode characters) that is supported by **Obsidian**.

## Using **Packrat**

**Packrat** adds a single command to the *Command Palette*.

Assuming that your active note contains one or more completed instances of recurring tasks, open the *Command Palette* and select "Packrat:  Process completed recurring Tasks within the active note".

When that command is issued, **Packrat** will scan the file for completed instances of recurring tasks and act upon each based upon any trigger value contained within it.

## Default 'archive file'

By default, **Packrat** appends completed recurring tasks that you want to archive to a file named `archive.md` located in the root directory of the vault -- it will create the file if it doesn't already exist.  

Both the location and name of this "archive file" can be changed in **Packrat**'s settings; the only requirement is that the file have an ".md" extension.

## Installation

**Packrat** has not yet been reviewed and accepted as a Community Plugin.

Until it is...

(*if* it ever is:  because I don't really know Typescript/Javascript, I pretty much hacked this together -- it probably doesn't meet code quality standards, and I may not be capable of doing much about that)

...this plugin can be installed manually as follows:

1. Create the following subidirectory of your **Obsidian** vault: `.obsidian/plugins/packrat/`
2. From the most recent Release for the repo, copy the files `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to that subdirectory
3. Within **Obsidian**, open your vault, go to Settings | Community Plugins; and in the 'Installed Plugins' section, click the *Reload Plugins* icon.
4. Enable the **Packrat** plugin (optionally changing its default settings.)
