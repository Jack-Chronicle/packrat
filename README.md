This plugin for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) adds functionality to Martin Schenk's excellent [Obsidian Tasks](https://github.com/schemar/obsidian-tasks) plugin.

Tasks supports recurring tasks:  when Tasks is used to mark such a task as having been completed, it creates the next instance of that task and inserts it in a new line immediately above the just-completed instance.

## The problem

While this default behavior is "alright" completed instances of recurring tasks tend to accumulate and clutter up the note file in which they originate.

My completed recurring tasks fall into three categories:

1. those that I want to move to the bottom of their note file
2. those that I want to archive within a separate note file
3. those that I don't need or want to keeof text p at all

## The solution

With a markdown note file open in **Obsidian**, select "Packrat:  Process completed recurring Tasks within the active note" from the *Command Palette*. **packrat** will scan the file for completed instances of recurring tasks and on each based upon any trigger value that it contains.

## Trigger values and archive file name and location

By default the trigger for each **packrat** action takes the form of an html comment. (This reflects my personal preference to avoid clutter in Preview mode and in the Tag pane.)

| Default triggers | Action on completed recurring task instance     |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------ |
| %%done_end%%     | Move task to the bottom of the active note file |
| %%done_log%%     | Append task to designated archive file          |
| %%done_del%%     | Delete task                                     |

However, the trigger values can be changed in **packrat**'s settings -- to #tags, or @values, or any other text string (including Unicode characters) supported by **Obsidian**.

By default, **packrat** appends tasks to a file named `archive.md` in the root directory of the vault -- it will create the file if it doesn't already exist.  Both the location and name of this "archive file" can be changed in **packrat**'s settings; the only requirement is that the file have an ".md" extension.

### Installation

**packrat** has not yet been reviewed and accepted as a Community Plugin.  

Until it is (*if* it ever is -- because I don't really know Typescript/Javascript, I pretty much hacked this together -- it may not meet code quality standards, and I may not be capable of changing that), **packrat** can be installed manually as follows:

1. Create the following subidirectory of your **Obsidian** vault: `.obsidian/plugins/packrat/`
2. From this repo, copy `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to that subdirectory
3. Within **Obsidian**, open your vault, go to Settings | Community Plugins; and in the 'Installed Plugins' section, click the *Reload Plugins* icon.
4. Enable **packrat** (optionally changing its default settings.)
